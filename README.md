```bash

This Markdown code combines a code block (in this case, Bash code) with an HTML button and a JavaScript function to copy the code block's content to the clipboard when the button is clicked. Keep in mind that Markdown is primarily for formatting text and doesn't provide direct support for interactive elements or scripting.
